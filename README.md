# Project 2: Comparative Graph Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes two large-scale graphs from different domains:
1. Facebook Social Network
2. Road Network of California (RoadNet-CA)

We compute key graph properties such as degree distribution, clustering, density, diameter, connected components, and centrality measures.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib pandas
